AIR POLLUTION
 
AIR POLLUTION IN KANPUR
 
Kanpur is a city in Uttar Pradesh, this city is already famous for its worst pollution management. Kanpur is a heavily populated city due to which a lot of traffic was always present on its roads. Due to this heavy traffic which
Increases the concentration of the automobiles, the fact is that having such traffic but this city doesn’t contain that infrastructure to handle that traffic to avoid less air pollutant as much as possible.
Kanpur is famous for industrialism having a lot of industries of material goods and urbanization present here, One of the major industries in this city is of leather products, heavy engineering, and tanneries. Which creates too much air pollutants which also creates a lot of air pollutants. This city is famous for trade and commerce in Uttar Pradesh.
Kanpur acquired notoriety as the second most polluted industrial city after Ahmedabad in terms of RSPM concentration.
In a recent survey it is found that the city Kanpur consistently obtains the Air Quality index (AQI) in the range between 130-170.
Here is the table to judge the air quality on the basis of AQI.
AQI
Air Pollution Level
0 - 50
Good
51 -100
Moderate
101-150
Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups
151-200
Unhealthy


Which puts it in the bracket of the Unhealthy and Sensitive group which may cause major disease issues to some senior citizens who were already facing problems of respiration.
Air pollution is not only dangerous for senior citizens but it may be dangerous for people belonging to other age groups.
This air pollution also plays a major role in causing diseases to people like eye irritation, asthma, bronchitis, etc... which eventually decrease the efficiency of people to work.
 
Sources of air pollutants
      	There are various sources which might cause the air pollution.
Some of them are: -
1.Motar Vehicles and automobiles.
2.Power plants and Oil refineries
3.Agriculture area
      	As Motor vehicles always remain a big issue In India which is the major cause of the air pollution, this problem arises due to having such a large population but having that much land to accommodate people.
Actually, according to traffic India doesn’t have that level of infrastructure which leads to heavy traffic, in heavy mobile sources it stands with them on engines which leads to burning of too much petrol, diesel which creates too much toxic gases which increases the concentration of air pollutants.
      	As we are in the industrialization era, there are too many power plants, Industries and oil refiners. In power plants there were a lot of burning of coal due to which a lot of toxic gases form some of them are carbon monoxide (CO), Oxides of nitrogen, Sulphur dioxide (SO2) which makes this fresh air too unhealthy and may cause some diseases to Human beings.
In Industries there too creates such toxic hydrocarbon gases like carbon dioxide (CO2).
      	When we think about air pollution we never consider our agriculture field but that too causes air pollution. When one crop cuts and famers are ready to grow another crop then they must have to burn the traces of the old crops and these farms are such in a wide range so this may lead to a heavy air pollution. One of the recent facts about this is burning of parali which always arises in the months of October and November in which Rice crops are cut down and are just going to grow the wheat crops for the winter session. This situation is created in the nearby states of New Delhi.
Where farmers are burning their traces of crops and a lot of air pollutants are generated.
 
Government Initiative
 	Taking the recent fact about the burning of parali by farmers the government just provided some free fertilizers to farmers which were obviously free of cost to our poor farmers, using these fertilizers farmers removes that unnecessary traces of old crops without burning them.
	Government also taken some strict action to nullify the cause of air pollution which were generated by mobile source they just make it compulsory to all type of Vehicle to carry a Pollution certificate under which the mobile engine just go in a test to check whether it is creating too much toxic gases or not if they were creating it then the owner of that vehicle must have to take some steps to stops contribution in air pollution which is causing due to his own vehicle.Indian government also raises awareness for using non polluting natural gases such as CNG,which can be used in buses and trucks.
	Government also gives the order to the industries to increase the height of the chimony so that air can traverse in the above environment without harming its lowest level.
	Government also establishes some solar energy plants to create some energy from there and avoid that traditional method of generating electricity from coal which creates too much air pollutants.

Initiative Must have to take
	Like 2-3 million deaths worldwide were linked to air pollution only .Even in my city Kanpur air quality is not so good which is leading to so many health issues .it's high time to think about steps which we can take towards the improvement of air quality in India but first we can start it from our city only here are some suggestion which we can do 
	In Kanpur this is going almost compulsory to improve infrastructure of roads because it is too dense city in which thousands of vehicles are on roads at the same time. 
	One of the major problems in the Kanpur city is the pollution due to industries so my suggestion is to shift some of those factories to nearby regions so that when air pollutants are generated then they can be accommodated by the fresh air as there was too much space between 2 factories.
As we all know, air pollution in our cities is increasing day by day with so much speed and it's a matter of great concern .
 We can start from our home the maximum amount of air pollutants come through the kitchen .the gas stove produces harmful contaminants like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide and nitrogen oxide which we can be easily absorbed into blood ,for your health,it's crucial to turn on kitchen vents on and allow air go outside or we can use biogas for the cooking like stuffs .
Secondly the air populations due to old diesel vehicles ,we have to monitor the cars and trucks conditions as well as sanction for those who fail to meet the limits ,which could help to reduce the  NOX emission from diesel passenger cars.
We also need to promote the e-mobility in our city ,the electric vehicle revolution can help in improvement of air quality it can only possible if we encourage people to buy e-vehicles instead of other ,setting up the stations for charging them, making policies so man can buy them .because e- vehicles is our future.even providing more space for bicycles on road and public transport as now metro rail is developing in Kanpur now we can encourage people use them instead of using personal vehicles unnecessary .
